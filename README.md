# Prototype for a game, made in Python

## Concept
Player chooses difficulty level. Game creates a labyrinth of some size. It is shown for set amount of time.
After that time or if player moves in any direction, walls of the labyrinth become hidden.
The goal of the game is to reach the exit without bonking the square head of your *character* into walls.
